#### To do:
- [ ] Add other configs
- [ ] Add other datasets in testing script
- [ ] Add training logs
- [x] Add dataset links
- [x] Add config explanation
- [x] Check environment setup on both Windows and Linux 
- [ ] Add instruction on how to adapt the method for your own model
- [ ] Check macenko_torch.py with newer pytorch versions
- [ ] Check whether wandb login info gets stored or not
- [x] Automate model selection
- [ ] List potential small erros due to hyperparameter changes
- [ ] Add test time stain normalization in val.py
- [x] Add ISW license
