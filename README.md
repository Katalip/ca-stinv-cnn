  <summary>Environment Setup</summary>
  
  ## Setup
  1. Create an environment:
  ```
  conda create -n <env_name> python=3.9
  ```
  2. This version of pytorch requires separate installation (creating env from env.yml file or requirements.txt does not find it)
  ```
  pip install torch==1.11.0+cu113 torchvision==0.12.0+cu113 torchaudio==0.11.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
  ```
  3. Install other necessary dependencies
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
